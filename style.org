As an organization we maintain a styleguide[fn:1] which lists all of
the style guidelines we use for our code. If you are contributing to
one of our projects, you should review and understand the relevant
sections below.

You should also review the [[file:ulang.org][ulang]] document, which may shine some light
on code comments and developer docs.

* General Programming

- indent-offset = 2
- max-line-width = 80

- start every source-file with a header comment
- use outline headings to organize your program
- use ulang-comments as needed for referencing bugs, notes, etc.
- inline documentation should be declarative. your code explains your
  comments for you.
