#+TITLE: style

As an organization we maintain a styleguide[fn:1] which lists all of
the style guidelines we use for our code. If you are contributing to
one of our projects, you should review and understand the relevant
sections below.

You should also review the [[file:ulang.org][ulang]] document, which may shine some light
on code comments and developer docs.
