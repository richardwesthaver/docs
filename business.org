The Compiler Company Business Model)}}}

In short, this document describes the business aspects of The Compiler
Company LLC. We are designed to be small, fast, and agile. We
infiltrate a market, apply our methodology, and develop solutions that
are simply years ahead of the competition. We treat the market like
we're the only supplier, because we can. This is in part due to our
internal research & development pursuits, but also our approach to
business. We build businesses and revenue streams the exact same way
we build software -- with a bottom up approach. This is our secret
weapon, and what gives us the ability to adapt to any environment
where our interests lie.
